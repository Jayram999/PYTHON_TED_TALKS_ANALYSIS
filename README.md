Description:
The TED Talks Data Analysis project aims to explore and analyze the TED Talks dataset to gain insights into the talks, speakers, and audience engagement. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and statistical summaries to understand various aspects of TED Talks, such as popularity, speaker demographics, talk duration, and audience interaction. The project utilizes Python programming language along with Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code for data analysis and visualization.

Objectives:

1. Explore and clean the TED Talks dataset.
2. Analyze the most viewed talks and popular speakers.
3. Investigate trends in TED Talk durations and publication dates.
4. Identify the most common speaker occupations and languages used in TED Talks.
5. Perform filtering and selection operations on the dataset to extract specific insights.

Tools Used:

1. Jupyter Notebook: for interactive data analysis, visualization, and documentation.
2. Visual Studio Code (VSCode): for writing, editing, and executing Python code.

Outcome:
The project provides valuable insights into the TED Talks dataset, allowing us to understand the dynamics of TED Talks, including audience preferences, speaker demographics, and topic popularity. By leveraging data analysis techniques, we gain actionable insights that can inform future TED Talk presentations, audience engagement strategies, and content creation decisions. Additionally, the project demonstrates the power of Python for data analysis and visualization tasks, along with the versatility of Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code as development environments for such projects.
